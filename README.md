# Full-Auto-Bowguns-FIX-TU4-MH-Wilds
# Credits to the original creator greydust


Hi! With the release of MH Wilds TU4, I wanted to use the "Full-Auto Bowguns" mod made by Greydust again. But because of some changes in TU4, the mod stopped working. So, with the help of two programmer friends, we managed to fix it.

I didn’t want to make a clone mod on Nexus Mods, since like 99% of the code is Greydust’s work, so I decided to upload it here to share it with people while the original mod hasn’t been updated.

I want to make it clear: the code isn’t mine. I just fixed it so it works with TU4 of MH Wilds. If the original creator wants to use this fix to update their mod, he's more than welcome. And if they want me to take this down, they can just contact me and I’ll remove it immediately.

Thanks and enjoy!


# How to Install

To install this fix, you just need to replace the "fabg.lua" file with the original one, and that should be enough. The fix should work with both keyboard and Xbox One controller. I’m not sure about other devices since I don’t have access to them to test it.
